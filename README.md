# MyLeague-react

This is a personal project of mine that consumes a League of Legends API to allow you to browse the current list of champions available. It is built with Reactjs and webpackjs.

Initially, the idea was to have a form box that asks for your name and type of role you prefer to play. The app would pick choose what kind of champion you should play accordingly. For now, it is simply a list of champions, clicking on one will show you more information about that champion.

I'm currently looking at omitting the form box for now, and adding more information into the specific champions' information. This includes:
* Splash art of the specific champion as the `background-image`
* A longer blurb
* List of Champion's abilities
* Gameplay videos of the champion and demo's of their abilities
* Implementaion of d3.js to visualize some of the information
* Make the app rensponsive
* Finally create the formbox and make it functional
